# hello-world
Hello! I'm a computer science student at Northwestern University. I like playing music, video games and some sports -- tennis and squash are my favorites. 

I'm setting up this GitHub account to build a portfolio of projects that I have done both in class and independently. 

I am not sure where I want to go in life but I love to learn new things; I often feel like I don't know enough but hopefully this GitHub will allow me to assess my progress over the years!
